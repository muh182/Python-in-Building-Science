# Python-in-Building-Science

## Basics
### Code Editing and Graphical User Interfaces
There are several platform for Python: 
* [Sypder IDE](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

An alternative approch is to use Google Colaboratory also known as [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). There are several good resources to show how to start using Colab:
* [Text Instructions](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-google-colab-f2fff97f594c)
* [YouTube Video Instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HnvsehuSw)

### Import Data

### Plotting

Several good resources for plots are:
* Example graphs using [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html)
* How to add [subplots](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/04.08-multiple-subplots.html)


## Applications 


Python also is used in different building science applications. Several examples are provided below:

### Psychrometrics
